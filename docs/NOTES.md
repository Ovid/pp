# Naming
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## PP

The name `PP` can stand for many things:

- PeePee
    - kinda like PyPy, but not in Perl and funnier to say
- Parde Perl
    - This dead horse has been sufficiently tenderized, lets make some sausage!
- Pretty Perl
    - Gonna try and remove as many warts as possible
- p5+
    - P(erl5) P(lus) some other stuff
        - not p5++ because we're taking stuff out as well as adding
            - this naming was coined by `mst` (see `HISTORY.md`)
    
## Curly

The name `curly` is the natural successor to `moe` and Perl is know for having
a lot of curly braces `{{{}}}` so it kinda works.

## Allium

The flower that grows out of an onion when you leave it in the ground for 
too long. Where the onion is the perl5 core, and the ground is the crushing 
pressure of backwards compatability.
