# Goal
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

It is sad to say, but Perl is dead. The community is largely dispersed and while
many exciting things are happening in the core right now, there is little 
enthusiasm left for Perl in the marketplace. 

This is *not* an attempt to revive Perl's place in the market, or to save CPAN, 
or the DarkPANs that exist in many company repos all over the planet. Those 
companies are all transitioning away from Perl anyway, which in turn greatly 
diminishes the value of CPAN as well. 

Instead, this *is* (kind of) an attempt to save Perl, perhaps at the expense 
of `perl`,  which I will expand on this further in other place.

So, as it says in the README, this repository asks the question:

If it ...
- looks mostly like Perl
- smells sort of like Perl
- even tastes a bit like Perl 
- but is *not* `perl` 

Is it Perl?

# Motivation
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

So if this is not about restoring Perl's place in the market, then what is 
the motivation? 

Nostalgia.

The goal is not to replace `perl`, nothing new could compare to 30 years of 
battle hardened C. The goal is to free Perl, the language, from those 30 
years of bondage. It won't be exactly the same Perl, but the goal is to capture
and distill the core essence of Perl, while removing the cruft. 

The first one is just for just for fun. For nostalgia and the love of Perl. 

Once Perl is free of `perl`, many avenues can be explored. 

Things like a production quality parser/compiler/runtime could be possible if 
we take advantage of the advances in compiler and interpreter technigues and 
technology that have occured in these last 30 years. But we will never know 
unless we try!

# Naming
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## PP

This is just a temporary name, but the name `PP` can stand for many things:

- PeePee
    - kinda like PyPy, but not in Perl and funnier to say
- Parde Perl
    - This dead horse has been sufficiently tenderized, lets make some sausage!
        - NOTE: "Parde" is "Horse" in Dutch
- Pretty Perl
    - Gonna try and remove as many warts as possible
- p5+
    - P(erl)5, +(plus) some other stuff
        - not p5++ because we're taking stuff out as well as adding
            - this naming was coined by `mst` (see `HISTORY.md`)
    
## Curly

The name `curly` is the natural successor to `moe` and Perl is know for having
a lot of curly braces `{{{}}}` so it kinda works.

## Allium

The flower that grows out of an onion when you leave it in the ground for 
too long. Where the onion is the perl5 core, and the ground is the crushing 
pressure of backwards compatability.
